# European Cities Climate Variable Analysis
This document outlines the process of analysing various aspects of four European Cities. 
The goal is to better understand how the climate changed during a specific time period.

Note: This is a personal project which aims to teach me how to drive a climate analysis, hone my Python coding skills for data analysis, its processes and other knowledge I find interesting or am passionate about (e.g., climate change, coding, analysis and many more, related or not, to this project). Everything is done on my spare time, continuous learning being a personal value. Any constructive feedback is appreciated.

## Introduction
Analysis of Climate Variables in four European cities, from 2008 to 2017, using data from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-urban-climate-cities?tab=overview).
The four cities selected are Berlin, Geneva, Lisbon, Tartu.
Multiple variables will be analysed, including Air Temperature, Wind speed, Relative humidity & more.
Data is requested from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), using an API key.

## CDS data access with API
Before any analysis can happen, data needs to be requested from CDS. The use of an API key is not necessary at this scale but an interesting thing to learn. Especially since it can be a transferable skill.
[Here](https://github.com/KemanGstl/European-Cities-Climate-Variable-Analysis/blob/main/CDS_Data_Access_With_API.md) is the process I went through for my first data set request, the Air Temperature variable.
